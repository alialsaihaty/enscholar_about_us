            <p>Three recent graduates set out to find the root of student engagement in the hopes of improving education for the next generation. They found that highly engaged students better understood their interests, strengths, and values, and made life decisions aligned with them.</p>
            <p>The evolution of enScholar would mirror the personal growth of each of the founders, who continued to seek out meaning and fulfillment in their own lives.</p>
            <p>Today, our team spans continents, cultures, and generations. We are truly a unique, passionate, and value-driven group that cares deeply about empowering today's youth.</p>

      <p>
        Our vision is to see young people lead better lives by making smarter career decisions. This is what gets us up in the morning and
        guides each decision we make. Our non-profit status is directly aligned with our value of transparency. It also allows us to partner
        with schools and other non-profit organizations so that we can reach more students, regardless of their economic status.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each dollar of revenue we generate goes back into improving and developing new features, resources, and content that will directly
        benefit you, the user. We're a lean, efficient organization, that runs like a regular business, except that we involve talented volunteers
        in everything that we do.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're creating huge value for young people, but we can't do it alone. If you’re interested in partnering/volunteering with us, or
        supporting us financially, please check out our volunteers page below, or contact us directly at info@enscholar.com.
